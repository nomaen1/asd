text = """Advertising companies say advertising is necessary and important. It informs people aboutnew products. Advertising hoardings in the street make our environment colourful. Andadverts on TV are often funny. Sometimes they are mini-dramas and we wait for the nextprogramme in the mini-drama. Advertising can educate, too. Adverts tell us about newhealthy products. And adverts in magazines give us ideas for how to look prettier, befashionable and be successful. Without advertising, life is boring and colourless.But some consumers argue that advertising is a bad thing. They say that advertising is badfor children. Adverts make children ‘pester’ their parents buy things for them. Advertisersknow we love our children and want to give them everything. So they use children’s ‘pesterpower’ to sell their products. Finally, consumers say, if there is advertising there must berules. Some adverts advertise unhealthy things like cigarettes and make people waste their money."""
